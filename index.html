                <h3>Multi Go</h3>
                <p>This game was designed many years ago when I first started learning programming languages and Python. Looking back, some coding styles and designs may not seem ideal to me now, but it remains an enjoyable game.

                    This is a simple Go game that allows three players to participate. The rules are identical to those of traditional Go, with the primary difference being the addition of a third player (the Blue one). Players of different colors are enemies to each other. They can cooperate to trap one another or try to win independently.
                    
                    The successful version 0.0 game is in multi_go_0.0.py</p>

                <h3>Server Placement and Task Allocation for Load Balancing in Edge-Computing Networks</h3>
                <p>While working as a Research Assistant at the Mobile Computing and Networking Lab, 
                    National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, 
                    I co-authored a research paper on improving computing services by offloading tasks to edge servers. 
                    This research aimed to reduce delays seen with cloud computing by smartly placing edge servers and evenly 
                    spreading out the workload. 
                    We created a new method using simulated annealing to find the best places for servers and 
                    used Lagrangian duality with the sub-gradient method for task allocation. 
                    Our tests showed that our method works better than older approaches, 
                    making user experiences better in mobile computing settings.</p>
