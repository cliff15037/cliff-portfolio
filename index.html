        <h1>Tzuyi Chuang - Software Engineer</h1>
        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Tzu-Yi (Cliff) Chuang, 
            a software engineer currently advancing my studies in Computer and Information Sciences at Virginia Tech. 
            I am passionate about exploring diverse technologies including systems engineering, 
            web backend development, and mobile applications. 
            My goal is to use this broad expertise to create software solutions that improve user engagement and operational efficiency.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, at Virginia Tech, 
            I'm engaged in developing projects that stretch my skills in new directions. 
            This semester, I have completed three significant projects: 
            a responsive bookstore web application, an enhancement for the PintOS operating system scheduler, 
            and an AI-powered coding assistant, 
            showcasing my ability to integrate complex software solutions with user-centric design.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Previously at Getac Technology Corporation, I focused on Android applications, 
            enhancing system stability and longevity. 
            I developed an automated testing application for Android tablets that streamlined the quality assurance process. 
            My academic research at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology involved designing algorithms for IoT networks, 
            which significantly improved network efficiency. 
            These experiences have deepened my technical skills and analytical abilities.
            As I continue to grow in my field, 
            I am eager to connect with professionals who are passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Let's collaborate and create impactful solutions together.</p>

                <h3>Multi Go</h3>
                <p>This game was designed many years ago when I first started learning programming languages and Python. Looking back, some coding styles and designs may not seem ideal to me now, but it remains an enjoyable game.

                    This is a simple Go game that allows three players to participate. The rules are identical to those of traditional Go, with the primary difference being the addition of a third player (the Blue one). Players of different colors are enemies to each other. They can cooperate to trap one another or try to win independently.
                    
                    The successful version 0.0 game is in multi_go_0.0.py</p>
